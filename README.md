# EnterpriseGDBInventory
Inventory the content of an ArcSDE Enterprise Geodatabase. Inventory feature classes, domains, and fields within
feature classes as well as details on each of these three elements. Write content to csv files.

20180118: Created branch for a redesign. Redesign will create environment independence, and remove functionality
for checking data against standards as this varies greatly with the user. 
New script will only process one sde file rather than any sde files in the directory of choice.
Script will no longer look for required fields, as they were employer specific.

20170804: uploaded files to capture progress. 
The code is not ready for use in any potential environment because it is specific to the environment in which it was developed.
 The code has also not been documented to explain its function. 
 Both of these items will come at a later date to finalize the project so it is readable, and usable in any environment.
